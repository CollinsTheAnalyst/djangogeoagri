    <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Often >100 cm; rooting may be limited if calcic horizon is cemented.</li>
    <li><strong>Workability:</strong> Light and easy to till, but prone to erosion and poor seedling establishment.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutrients & CEC:</strong> Very low fertility and CEC; Ca may be adequate but N, P, K often deficient.</li>
    <li><strong>pH:</strong> Neutral to alkaline, buffered by calcium carbonate.</li>
    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Add organic matter, use split/slow-release fertilizers, maintain ground cover, and grow deep-rooting crops.</li>

<h3>Ferric Arenosols</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sandy soils with a ferric horizon enriched in iron oxides, often reddish/yellowish. May harden into ferricrete (ironstone).</li>
    <li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Very well drained; water infiltrates quickly but retention is poor.</li>
    <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Usually >100 cm, but rooting may be limited if ferric horizon hardens.</li>
    <li><strong>Workability:</strong> Easy to till when loose, but hardened ferric horizons restrict tillage and roots. Soils prone to erosion and crusting.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutrients & CEC:</strong> Very low fertility and CEC. N, P, K often deficient. Iron abundant but may fix P, reducing availability.</li>
    <li><strong>pH:</strong> Generally acidic to slightly neutral; lacks carbonate buffering.</li>

    "Luvic Arenosols": """
<h3>Luvic Arenosols</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sandy soils with a <strong>luv(ic) horizon</strong>: a subsurface clay-enriched horizon (Bt) formed by downward movement (illuviation) of clay.</li>
    <li><strong>Drainage:</strong> The clay-enriched subsoil may impede drainage and cause temporary waterlogging in wet seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Usually very deep (>100 cm), but effective rooting depth may be reduced if the clay horizon is dense/compacted.</li>
    <li><strong>Workability:</strong> Sandy surface is easy to till and light to work with. Subsoil clay can be sticky when wet and hard when dry, making deep cultivation difficult.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutrients & CEC:</strong> Higher nutrient retention than other Arenosols due to clay accumulation, but still low in organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Base saturation can be moderate if the clay is active.</li>
    <li><strong>pH:</strong> Slightly acidic to neutral, depending on clay type and leaching.</li>
    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Build organic matter in topsoil, break compacted clay layers (deep tillage/subsoiling), apply balanced N and P fertilizers, maintain residues/cover crops to reduce erosion, and grow crops tolerant to variable moisture (e.g., maize, millet, groundnuts).</li>

    <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Very deep (>100 cm), but root growth restricted by shrink–swell movements and alternating wet/dry stress.</li>
    <li><strong>Workability:</strong> Very difficult to manage. Sticky and heavy when wet; cloddy and hard when dry. Narrow workable moisture window.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutrients & CEC:</strong> High CEC (30–80 cmol(+)/kg), high base saturation (50–100%), rich in Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. Low in N, P, organic matter, S, and Zn.</li>
